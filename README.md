**It will allow you to interact with the openAI API to perform scripting operations on your computer.**

## About this project

Using this tool, you will be able to quickly refer to the OpenAI API (ChatGPT) to receive a script that allows you to perform a specific operation on your computer.

## How to use

![MainForm_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d69cd0-2be3-4990-ab69-a38ee2b61528)


The process involves sending a query with information about what you want to do, e.g. 
"I want to delete all temporary files", the AI ​​analyzes your query, 
prepares an appropriate script that will clear temporary files, and returns it to you in response.

The issue of executing scripts generated by the AI ​​sounds irrational, so after receiving the script, it is not executed automatically. 
This script is saved on a separate list together with the query for which it was generated. 
In the next step, you can load this script into another window where you can analyze it once again 
and modify it if necessary before you decide to execute it.

#### !!! To copy the script to the left window, you need to double-click on the Result cell.

If we decide that the script we have prepared for execution is correct, we can run it. 
In the background, the PowerShell console will start, in which the script will be executed, 
and the logs from the console will appear in the lower panel in the main application window.

## Disclaimer
For correct operation, an API key from OpenAI is required. More information can be found [here](https://openai.com/api/).

When executing the script, the Powershell console is launched in the background, so it is important to remember that the script must be written in such a form that it can be executed in it.


Communication with AI text services such as ChatGPT requires some skill and the ability to formulate queries, so we recommend that before starting to work with this solution,
you try to "talk" and test work with this or similar services to avoid unnecessary costs at the trial stage.

The authors of the solution are not responsible for the quality and content generated by the OpenAI API, and do not take responsibility for the effects of invoking scripts generated by it.
